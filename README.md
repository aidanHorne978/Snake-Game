# Snake-Game-AI-Agent
A simple snake game made in Python using the PyGame library

This repository contains the code for my Snake Game AI project. The AI agent uses a genetic algorithm to learn how to play Snake.

Currently, the agent has a 12 neuron input layer, 3 hidden layers of 120 neurons, and a 4 output neuron layer that contains the probability for each direction.

By the end of this project I want the user to be able to train up a snake and then vs them in a battle to see who wins.
